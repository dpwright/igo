igo
===

This package aims to provide a comprehensive set of rules and utilities for
dealing with the game of go in Haskell.  It allows you to track a game and make
queries of the board, taking into account the various rulesets in play.

What this package does not provide is any sort of artificial intelligence to
actually *play* go, but it is hoped that it would prove useful in writing one.
